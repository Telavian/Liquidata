# Web Security
Due to how Liquidata operates entirely within the browser, then there are some security concerns to handle when loading other sites to interact with them. This is not a problem when running in offscreen, or the background mode, however it can be a challenge in the Liquidata Client itself. There are however simple and easy workarounds to get the client working as expected.
