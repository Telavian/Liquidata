# Scope Action
The Scope Action is used to change the name of the extract data and add a defined prefix. This can be useful when some extracted data fields can be grouped.

| Name             | Defines the name of the scope to use for all child actions. This scope will be active only within the child actions of the scope action itself. All fields will be prepended with the name of the scope. This can make it make simpler to relate specific pieces of information.  |
