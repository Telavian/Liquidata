# Loop Action
The Loop Action is used to execute a sequence of actions a specific number of times. This can be helpful when a set number of times is known such as loading more, through a scroll action, a specific amount of times, or when a set number of items should be operated on.

## Options
| Option           | Description |

| Max times        | Defines the maximum amount of times to perform the loop operation. A value of 0 means loop until a stop action is executed. |
