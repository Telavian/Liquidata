# Liquidata Emporium

The Emporium is an application that was created as a safe place to test Liquidata or any other means of extracting data from a web page. It will never block users or make it difficult to access to thrwart data extraction. It should be noted though, that all data is generated as needed and is entirely random. However, once the data is generated then it is reused until cleared.

### Description
The Emporium offers three different types of pages, each of which has a different style. 

#### Main page
The main page is the entry point for the emporium and offers a simple overview style of display. It offers category navigation on the left side of the page and along with three random categories and some products from each category.

#### Category page
The category page allows the user to view and filter all the products associated with the given category. Users can navigate to other categories through the category menu on the left. Otherwise they can filter the category products by using the product filter at the top of page. Lastly, users can page through all the products as needed through a page navigation at the bottom of the page.

#### Item page
The item page is used to show all the details for a single product. Each product is assigned random values for the basic properies. However each product is also assigned a set of random product attributes which are used to simulate product specific fields. Products will also get a set of random user reviews which can be searched or paged as needed. 

### Clear data
In the event that new Emporium data is wanted then the existing randomly generated data can be cleared by clearing all data currently stored in local storage of the browser. Depending on the browser, this may be performed in a few different ways. Once the data is cleared then the Emporium is returned back to the inital state and data is regenerated as needed.
